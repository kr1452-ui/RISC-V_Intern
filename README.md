RISC-V Embedded Firmware Internship 
Task 1: Firmware Foundations & Environment Setup
This project is part building my foundation in Embedded Firmware, focusing on RISC-V SoC architecture. It demonstrates how we bridge the gap between high-level C code and physical hardware registers in a bare-metal environment (no OS/RTOS).

The goal was to move away from writing raw values to memory addresses and instead build a Firmware Library that makes hardware control intuitive and reusable.
